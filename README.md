# ETMO-NAS: An Efficient Two-step Multimodal One-shot NAS for lung nodules classification

## HighLights
* 1.	We propose a multimodal one-shot NAS structure for searching the optimal feature extraction network architecture in PET/CT imaging of lung nodules.
* 2.	We design an efficient two-step training strategy for full training and further fine-tuning to improve the performance of candidate architectures.
* 3.	ETMO-NAS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to classical models.
